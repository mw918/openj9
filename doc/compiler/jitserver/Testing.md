There are currently 2 supported test procedures. Select the one that best suits your neeeds.

- [Testing locally](#local). Choose this if you have build & test dependencies set up.
- [Testing in Docker](#docker). Choose this if you don't want to deal with build & test dependency setups.

## LOCAL

These are the steps to run the tests on your machine.

1. Compile a debug build of openj9 from scratch. To do this pass the flag `--with-debug-level=slowdebug` to `configure`.

2. Install [prerequisites](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/test/docs/Prerequisites.md)

   Example installation can be found [here](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/buildenv/docker/test/Dockerfile#L57-L68).
3. Compile  the tests (only need to compile once):
   ```
   cd $OPENJ9_DIR/openj9/test
   git clone https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TKG.git
   cd TKG
   export JAVA_VERSION=SE80
   export JAVA_BIN=/your/sdk/jre/bin
   export SPEC=linux_x86-64_cmprssptrs
   ```
   Either `TEST_FLAGS` or `EXTRA_OPTIONS` can be used to run tests with JITServer. The following will launch both the server and the client during the test.
   ```
   export TEST_FLAG="JITAAS"
   ```
   The following sets up only the client side which requires manually starting the server before running the test.
   ```
   export EXTRA_OPTIONS=" -XX:+UseJITServer " # spaces at the start and end are important!
   ```
   NOTE: It's important to put spaces before and after `-XX:+UseJITServer`, otherwise
   some tests will not run properly.

   Compile the test
   ```
   make compile
   ```
   NOTE: to compile and run tests, ant-contrib.jar is needed, and on some systems just installing ant will not install ant-contrib.
   On Ubuntu, the easiest way to get it is to run:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install ant-contrib
   ```


4. Run the tests!

   Manually start the server if `JITAAS` TEST_FLAG is not used.
   ```
   $JAVA_BIN/jitserver
   ```
   ```
   make _sanity
   ```
   
5. To rerun the failed tests, run
   ```
   make _failed
   ```
   which tests will be rerun can be modified in `failedtargets.mk`.

   or, if you want to run an individual test, run
   ```
   make <name_of_the_test>
   ```

For more advanced testing features, refer to [this guide](https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/test/docs/OpenJ9TestUserGuide.md).

## DOCKER

Follow the [Docker.md](Docker.md) here for building then testing JITServer in Docker.
